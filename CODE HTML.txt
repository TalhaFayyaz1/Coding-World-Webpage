        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on "speed of service" versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science. Fast food was originally created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers who often did not have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait for their meal. By making speed of service the priority)</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Hotel design involves the planning, drafting, design and development of hotels.[1] The concept of hotel design is rooted in traditions of hospitality to travellers dating back to ancient times,[2] and the development of many diverse types of hotels has occurred in many cultures. For example, the advent of rail travel in the early 1900s led to the planning, design and development of hotels near railroad stations that catered to rail travelers.[3] Hotels around Grand Central Terminal in New York City are an example of this phenomenon.[4] Hotel interior design and styles are very diverse, with numerous variations existent.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Coffee & Sweats  </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Coffee houses basically fall into two types, though the distinction is rather blurred nowadays. A Kaffeehaus, which is traditionally preferred by men but enjoyed by everyone, offers games such as chess and billiards and serves wine, beer, spirits and light meals. A Cafe Konditorei attracts more women and typically has a salon look with rococo mouldings and painted glass. Aida is a particularly popular chain of Konditorei, a totally pink affair where you can discuss your latest operation or the neighbour's new driveway with the old ladies at the next table. A wide variety of cakes and pastries is usually on offer.</p>
